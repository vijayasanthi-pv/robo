	<h1>Firmware demo project</h1>
	
	<h2>Welcome :-)</h2>
	
	<p>
		Hi and welcome to the firmware demo project!
		<br />
		This is a toy project that should give you a tiny insight into our world and especially into how we do server development at Robart.
		Please note though that this does not entirely reflect how we are developing server applications. 
		Most importantly we do not use <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html" target="_blank">Jdbc(Template)</a> directly anymore but rather the (in our opinion) more convenient <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/" target="_blank">Spring data JPA</a>.
		However if one has not worked with the Java Persistence API (JPA) or Hibernate before we thought that it is easier to stick to JDBC and direct SQL queries instead.
		<br />
		Furthermore we usually separate things more clearly and create separate task specific controllers / repositories. Also we normally have a service layer in-between the controller and the repository but that simply does not matter for this project.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The Setting</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This server should simulate a simplistic firmware server. This means a server which allows an admin to store a firmware on the server and associate it with one or more robots.</li>
		<li>For a user it should be possible to download the firmware for a robot by simply giving the name of the robot.</li>
		<li>All the interfaces should be REST calls. This means that for all the tasks it should be possible to use a tool like <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/" target="_blank">curl</a> to access the interface.</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Hints</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The used database is in-memory (H2). You can access it via <a href="http://localhost:8080/h2-console" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/h2-console</a>
			<br />
			The required settings can be found in the application.yml file. For the JDBC URL please specify "jdbc:h2:mem:demo_project" for "User Name" "h2user" and for "Password" "h2pass".
		</li>
		<li>
			The classes for the controller (DemoprojectController.java) and the Jdbc Repository (DemoprojectRepository.java) already exist. Just extend it with the logic you need in order to complete the requested tasks. 
		</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<h2>The Tasks</h2>
	
	<ol>
		<li><b>CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) for firmwares</b></li>
		Extend the project(sample call e.g. <a href="http://localhost:8080/robots/all" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/robots/all</a>) such that is possible to:
		<ul>
			<li>List all available firmwares</li>
			<li>Upload a new firmware</li>
			<li>Delete a specific firmware</li>
			<li>Update a specific firmware (change the name or the data)</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		
		<li><b>Associate one or multiple robots with a particular firmware</b></li>
		Extend the project such that is possible to associate one or multiple robots with a particular firmware.
		<br />
		For that task you also need to extend the database as the current data model does not cater for this at the moment. 
		Just add your SQL statements to <span style="font-family: Courier;">db/migration/V1__Init.sql</span>. They will be applied automatically next time you start the application.
		<br />
		One firmware should be assignable to multiple robots.
		It should be possible to pass multiple robot IDs to the controller to associate a bunch of robots with one firmware at once.
		<br />
		It would be great if you design the feature such that you keep a history of all the firmwares that have ever been associated with a robot inclusive of when this association has happened.  
	 	<br /><br />
	 	
	 	<li><b>Allow to download the latest firmware of a robot by giving its name</b></li>
	 	Finally, this is the user side of the server.
	 	<br />
	 	By placing a simple HTTP call that includes the robot's name as parameter, one should get the currently associated firmware for the given robot.
		<br /><br />
	</ol>
	<h2>Bonus objectives</h2>
    <ol>
		<li>Secure the api so that authentication needed to access it. The details up to you</li>
		<li>The service starts getting lots of traffic. Therefore we needed scale up your application. Adjust your solution for us to be able to run with multiple instances.(Data consistency between instances should be ensured.)</li>
		<li>A Dockerfile and a script for building Docker image for your application</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Your solution will be evaluated based on</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Correctness</li>
		<li>Api Design(RESTful conventions & Best practices)</li>
		<li>Maintainability(Readable & reusable codes,tests)</li>

	</ul>
